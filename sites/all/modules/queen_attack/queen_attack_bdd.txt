1. Make menu item for queen attack page 🍄
2. Make FORM on queen attack page 💄
3. SUBMIT form function to redirect to success page 💥
    - pass information to SUCCESS FUNCTION 💯
4. MENU CALLBACK to create success page 🍻
5. SUCCESS FUNCTION prints results on success page 🍾

Logic:

1. return two coordinate inputs (in 8x8 board)
2. see if they are horizontally aligned
3. see if they are vertically aligned
4. see if they are diagonally aligned
5. return TRUE or FALSE
